# MELA. The meaning of language

A text tagging and translation platform developed for the research project [MELA: The MEning of Language - A digital grammar of the Greek taught at schools in late Constantinople](https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/projects/mela-meaning-language-digital-grammar-greek-taught-schools-late-constantinople).

## Components

The platform consists of a bunch of Docker containers which each have some functionality:

* Front-end: A Nuxt front-end with an SSR component for server side rendering and authentication callbacks. 
* Back-end: a Python back-end based on litestar.
* Database: A PostgreSQL dababase to store the application data.
* Authentication service: Keycloak provides user authentication and management. It also integrates with the several identity providers such as the Ghent University identity provider.
* Elasticsearch service: provides a way to quickly do full-text or faceted search.

## Running and development

Check the configuration in the `.env` variables file and run Docker compose:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up
```

Make sure the following is added to your hosts file

echo "127.0.0.1 mela.keycloak\n127.0.0.1 mela.frontend\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
